I'm  a technical leader with 15+ years' experience helping companies move from anecdotal decision making to driving strategies with data. I’ve provided code, technical leadership and team building in web development and online marketing, front-end data visualization, business intelligence systems implementations and production-ready data pipelines. I’m happiest helping teams of data engineers, analytics engineers, analysts and developers succeed in a culture of learning and growth. 

Like many people these days, I'm looking for a job. [Connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bellmartin/)
